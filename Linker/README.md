# Linker
The "linker.py" file is the file which is supposed to simulate a linker, which takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into one, executable program.

The "main.cpp" file is the input file being being read by the python file.

The "ex.cpp" file has some external variables declared in it. This file is being included in the "main.cpp" file.

The output of the linker program is displaying the GVT (Global variable table) and the EVT (External variable table).
