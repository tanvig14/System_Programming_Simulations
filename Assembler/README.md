# Assembler
This code takes an input file which has some assembly language code in it and simulates all the functions an assembler would to convert the assembly language code to machine code. 

The output (opcode and address of each command) is written to a target file and you can optionally print the Symbol Table, MOT, POT, variables, etc. while executing the program.
