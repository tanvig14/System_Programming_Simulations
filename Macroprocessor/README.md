# Macroprocessor
These are programs to process macros with and without parameters.

"Input1.txt" is the input file for simple macro processing and "Input2.txt" is for macros with parameters. They both have assembly language code with macros.

The output is the resultant assembly language code after resolving the macros and (optionally) printing the MDT, MNT and ALA.
