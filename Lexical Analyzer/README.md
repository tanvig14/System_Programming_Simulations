# Lexical Analyzer
This program simulates what the lexican analyzer component of a compiler would be achieving, i.e. mainly dividing the keywords in a given program into tokens.

The input here is to be hard coded and is not being taken in the form of a file/user input. You can make that edit if you wish.
